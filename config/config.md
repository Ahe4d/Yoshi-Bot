# Configuration

The `config.json` defines several settings for the selfbot, such as the client token (for logging into the Discord API) and the selfbot prefix (for "talking" to the selfbot)

The structure for `config.json` is as follows:
```json
{
  "prefix": "prefix",
  "token": "clienttoken"
}
```
>Your prefix can be something like 'a!'


>**NOTE:** Don't give out your client token to anyone; they can use it to login to the Discord API and do malicious stuff under your name!

After you are finished making changes to the configuration, save the file as `config.json`.
