# selfbit - configuration

The `config.json` defines several settings use, such as the client token and selfbot prefix.

The structure for `config.json` looks like this:
```json
{
   by using developer mode, in user settings > appearance
  "prefix": "prefix", //selfbot prefix, something like 'a!'
  "token": "clienttoken", //your client token, can be grabbed in the desktop client by going into developer tools > application > local storage, obviously you shouldn't give this to anyone
  "version": "whatever version lol" //don't touch please thanks
}```

After you are finished setting up the configuration, save the file as `config.json`.
