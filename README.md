# selfbit
A Discord selfbot written in Node.js

Selfbit is built off [Woofie-Woof's Yoshi-Bot](/Woofie-Woof/Yoshi-Bot) and is modified to work with loading modules in their own commands for organization. You can read about how modules work in `modules.md` in the modules directory or on the [wiki page](./wiki/Modules).

## Running
If you're interested in running the selfbot, [head here](./wiki/Getting-Started).
