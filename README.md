A Discord selfbot written in Node.js.

## Running
If you're interested in running the selfbot, [head here](https://github.com/AheadBL/selfbit/wiki).


Selfbit is built off [Woofie-Woof's Yoshi-Bot](https://github.com/Woofie-Woof/Yoshi-Bot) and is modified to work with a module system to organize commands and more. You can read about how modules work in `modules.md` in the modules directory.
