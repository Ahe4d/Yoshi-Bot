# selfbit
A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) selfbot written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library
***


## Getting Started
If you're interested in running the selfbot, [head here](https://github.com/Ahe4d/selfbit/wiki/Getting-Started).

Selfbit is built off [Woofie-Woof's Yoshi-Bot](https://github.com/Woofie-Woof/Yoshi-Bot) and is modified to work with loading modules in their own files for organization. You can read about how modules work in `modules.md` in the `modules` directory or on the [wiki page](https://github.com/Ahe4d/selfbit/wiki/Modules).
